        <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
          <p>I love Pandora Internet Radio. You can type in any artist, song, or
            genre and it will stream a playlist of songs that it thinks you will
            enjoy. I mainly use Pandora at home or at work, but rarely in my
            car. </p><p>I found this strange at first, but I realized that most of my
            mobile usage in the car is in landscape orientation, mostly utilizing
            navigation, and with the phone at a further distance away than regular
            use.</p>
          <p>The problem with this is that Pandora's landscape UI is not very useful
            like this. It is merely a "fluid" application (rearragement of existing UI elements)
            of the UI. However, I believe it would add
            functionality to the app if the Landscape orientation would provide
            a different interface than the default screen.</p>

            <p><b>This is a personal case study and design for exploration.</b></p>
          </div>

        <div class="row">


          <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
            <p>My main concern with the landscape layout is that the controls
              and information are too small to be <em>viewed</em> and <em>used</em> at a distance.
              Indeed, the size and function of the UI is largely the same in portrait
              orientation as in landscape. Lists are the same height, and the viewport for
              selecting new and existing radio stations is able to display less information than it does
              in portrait orientation. </p>

            <p>The way the phone is being interacted with is important as well.
              By that, I mean that when used in-car, it is generally suspended on a mount rather
              than being held in the hand of the user. This is important because
              cradling the phone grants the ability to anchor your movement, allowing the use
              of smaller icons. When the phone is in midair, targets that were previously simple
              to hit become much more difficult.</p>

            <p>The standard touch input of smartphones
              is already extremely sensitive to jostling and bumping.
              If you've ever tried to adjust the radio while driving, you know that
              drivers are already prone to making many errors with input due to
              bumps and distractions. Because the buttons are so
              close together and small, any jostling in the car will almost certainly
              result in an incorrect input. To top it off, the control buttons for playback
              are actually <em>closer</em> together in landscape than in portrait orientation.</p>

              <p>My initial impulse was to increase the button target size, and thus easier to
                see and touch without causing errors. However, I experienced a touch
                screen car radio that attempted to use this paradigm and I observed that
                touchscreen buttons without a physical sense to indicate where the
                user's hand position is extremely prone to mistakes. There is no tactile feedback
                for whether what the user is doing has been accomplished or not.</p>

              <p>To counter this, I thought that a gestural input would provide
                a better experience. By adding swipe controls for the main functions,
                we could turn what was once a micro-movement
                (movements requiring a high level of accuracy) into a macro-movement,
                an action that is easily accomplished in an environment where accuracy
                is not always possible.
              </p>
              <div class="text-center"><img src="./resources/pandora/touch.jpg" width="100%"><h5>Gesture Input Wireframe</h5>
              </div>
              <p>Ultimately, the gesture interface seemed like the most effective option
                to explore for prototyping and testing due to its unlikelyhood for mistaken inputs.</p>

            <p>Designing the final touch interface proved interesting when addressing the
              ability to swipe the album art. My initial idea was to place a tab-like
              spot on the right of the screen that would be swiped from the right to the left
              to skip to the next song.</p>
            <div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:20px;"><img src="./resources/pandora/firstproto.png" width="100%"></div>
            <p>However, this design does not follow swipe patterns that exist
              in existing apps. Take, for example, the Facebook Messenger bubble. Dragging the bubble
              to the bottom of the screen closes the on-screen app. Or on quick-meet apps like Tinder or Shapr,
              where you swipe the profile icon to the left or right to indicate whether you'd like to meet
              someone or not.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
            <p>As a result, I thought to use the album art as a draggable object
              that the user would be able to drag into different actions; actions that appear when
              the user begins to drag the icon.</p>

            The next step to this project would be testing a prototype in a real-world
              environment, preferably mounted on a dashboard in a vehicle. I believe this
              interface, supported by with a simple onboarding overlay, will provide a
              superior automotive experience.</p>
